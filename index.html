   <p> The death penalty, considered the worst punishment given to criminals in the United States Prison System, is a very controversial topic that has been discussed heavily throughout recent years. Many states have been outlawing the death penalty entirely, and the states that still have it are sentencing convicts with capital punishment less and less. Many think the death penalty should be banned entirely as it is an inhumane act and slightly hypocritical of the U.S. Department of Justice. </p>

   <p> This will continue to be a topic of debate in the future, which is why the data is interesting to look at, to see commonalities and developments towards the nationwide abolishment of the death penalty. </p>

   <p> The Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit organization providing information and data on the death penalty in the United States, compiled prison data regarding every case of capital punishment since 1977. Their data does not only list every case but lists who is executed and other details about the case. Additionally, the data provides the name and background of all perpetrators and executions for the past 40+ years, the botched executions, which listed the numbers of executions that went wrong and what methods were used for them, the innocence data, which is all of the men and women on death row who turned out to be innocent, and the executions scheduled for the remainder of 2021. </p>

   <p> A major implication of capital punishment is the possibility of wrongful convictions, which has provied itself to be fairly prevalent in the U.S. This can be a result of false testimonies and eyewitness identifications, coerced confessions, poor legal defense, among other circumstances.  </p>
   
   <p>According to the Equal Justice Initiative, as well as the data provided, 1 in 9 people on death row have been exonerated due to a wrongful conviction. That is 186 people since 1973.</p>

   <p> The data helps prove that capital punishment is not a strongly supported concept in the United States, and will most likely be abolished nationwide eventually. Wrongful convictions based on varying circumstances have led to the execution of innocent people. Even those who are exonerated sometimes have to sit on death row for decades, serving time in a dehumanizing place for something they did not do.  </p>

   <p> Clifford Williams, a Black man from Florida, served 43 years for a murder he did not commit until his charges were finally dismissed. The data also shows over 200 botched executions, which is a traumatic experience regardless of the circumstances and should never occur. The botched executions were most plentiful with lethal injection deaths which is most commonly used today in prisons. </p>

   <p> As of November 2021, capital punishment is still legal in 27 states. Many of these states have coalitions, nonprofits, and other groups actively working to abolish the death penalty, whether it is for that one state or nationwide. In these 27 states, some have barely convicted many people at all, especially in the past few years. Idaho has only ever sentenced 3 people to death, and Indiana has not sentenced someone to death in 12 years.  </p>

   <p> On the contrary, states like Alabama and Texas continue to use it, each sentencing multiple convicts to death within the year. </p>

   <p>The data shows that Oklahoma Julius Jones was sentenced to be executed November 18th, 2021. Fortunately, Jones was granted clemency 4 hours before his execution. A change.org petition explained that Jones was arrested for this murder he allegedly did not commit when he was 19 years old. He lives 23 hours a day in solitary confinement, is granted one hour of sunlight, and 3 showers a week. </p>

   <p> Although now he is not sitting awaiting his death, he is still not free. He still has to serve life in prison without the possibility of parole, and he is an innocent man. This has been all too common in the US Justice System, and in recent years, people aren't standing for it anymore.</p>

   <p> The future of the death penalty in the United States seems promising, as less and less states are using it frequently and more and more states are abolishing it entirely. “This year, even though we still have 11 executions, which is 11 too many, this year had the fewest number of executions on record in the modern era of the death penalty,” Alli Sullivan, a volunteer worker at Death Penalty Action said. </p>

   <p> Death Penalty Action is an organization founded in early 2017 after Donald Trump, a “strong proponent for the dealth penalty,” was sworn into office. The goal of Death Penalty Action is to spread awareness across the United States, to let Americans know how large of an issue capital punishment is. Although no federal executions are occurring right now, the organization aims to fight against the death penalty on a state level as well. Organizations like this one, as well as Equal Justice USA, will help for this punishment to become a thing of the past. 
  </p>

   <p> Sam Heath, a Manager at Equal Justice USA, sounds hopeful about the future of the death penalty. “I believe the death penalty will be gone federally and at the state level within the next 20 years,” he said. “The work now is to engage each state that still has the death penalty and to encourage Biden's administration to end the death penalty federally.” </p>
     


   <p>Sullivan also mentioned that luckily, some states still have a death penalty, but do not use it. Oregon for example, has only executed 2 people, and both were voluntary. Other states, like Oklahoma and Texas, who continue to execute many, might take a lot longer to eradicate capital punishment. No one is sure when it will capital punishment will be abolished nation wide, but organizations like Equal Justice USA, Death Penalty Action, and many others, are hoping to make this happen soon. </p>
