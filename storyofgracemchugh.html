    <h1>The Story of Grace McHugh</h1>

    <h2>
      This is a little bit about my life and childhood.
    </h2>

    <p>
      My name is Grace McHugh, and I was born in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, a suburb 25 minutes outside of Philadelphia. I have an older brother, Tommy, who is 21, and a little sister, Claudia, who is 17. When I was 8 years old, my family got a cat, Lincoln, and when I was 11, we got a dog named Georgie. He is a Shih Tzu/Poodle mix.
